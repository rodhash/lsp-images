An automated pipeline for building, testing, and distributing lightweight, containerized Language Servers (LSPs). This project uses **Nix** and **Podman** to ensure every LSP is minimal, reproducible and ready for use in development environments like Neovim (the only one tested so far).

> [!WARNING]
> **Work In Progress (WIP)**: This is my first public repository and a learning project. Things may change frequently, and while I use these images daily, you should use them at your own risk. Expect breaking changes as I refine the factory!
